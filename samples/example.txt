Text compression is the technique of reducing the size of a text file to optimize storage and transmission. This process involves identifying and removing redundancies, patterns, or encoding text in a more efficient manner. Various algorithms like Huffman coding, Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW), and arithmetic coding are used for this purpose. Each algorithm employs different strategies to achieve compression, with some focusing on frequency-based encoding while others exploit patterns or dictionary-based approaches. Compression ratios can vary depending on the algorithm and the characteristics of the text, with some achieving significant reductions in file size while preserving the integrity of the original data. Text compression plays a crucial role in data storage, transmission, and communication systems, enabling more efficient use of resources.
